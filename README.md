# _nand computer
Creating a computer from the very first principles - both software and hardware. <p>
All the computation is based on the chip Nand. <p>
Based on [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) <p>

## Hardware
Currently the most basic chips are implemented: Nand, Not, And, Or, Xor, Mux, DMux as well as their multi-bit and multi-way versions.
The implementation is in the namespace `BasicGates`. <p>
Testing capacities are provided as well - in form of the class `TestBasicGates`.
There are 2 parameters: `RANDOM_AMOUNT_N`, which specifies how thoroughly the functions are tested (higher = more tests),
and `EXHAUSTIVE_TIME_N`, which allows to measure time more precisely (higher = more precise).<p>
Current results: <p>
